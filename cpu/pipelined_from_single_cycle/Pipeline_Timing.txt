For store operation after register operation
    register operation takes
        x
    clock cycles to update register

    store operation needs 1 registers before address can be calculated
    store operation needs another register for data to write

for SW instruction
    we should toggle 2 cycles later?

    1   register values are available   update set
    2   register is updated

For SW
